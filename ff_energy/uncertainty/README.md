The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `DataLoader`: A class to load and preprocess the data from the csv file.
2. `UncertaintyQuantifier`: A class to calculate the uncertainty using different methods.
3. `Plotter`: A class to generate the required plots.
4. `LatexTableGenerator`: A class to generate the Latex table.
5. `main`: The main function that ties everything together.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `main.py`.
